# Blazor REPL

## What is Blazor REPL?
[Blazor REPL](https://blazorrepl.com) is a platform for writing, compiling, executing and sharing [Blazor](https://blazor.net) components entirely in the browser. It's perfect for code playground and testing. It's fast and secure. The platform is built and is running entirely on top of Blazor WASM - the [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) hosting model of Blazor.
